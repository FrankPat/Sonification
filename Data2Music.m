% Function that reads a two column data vector with x and y values, where x
% is commonly taken as time in a time series, and interpolates a sequence
% of 'sequence' number of notes between 'startseq' and 'endseq'. The
% function calls firt the Sonification function that outputs
% 'ScaleIndices', i.e., the number of the notes within the chosen scale, as
% well as 'NewScale', which are the frequencies that correspond to each of
% the chosen major scale. In a next step a sound signal is produced, using
% the function MakeSoundScale. Finally the original data and the
% interpolated scale based on the data are plotted in one figure.
