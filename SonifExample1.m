% In this example, the Key is B flat major (BbM7), resulting in B flat and
% E flat as key signatures. The key is similar to C minor 7 (Cm7), so if
% you want a minor key, you need to provide the key of the associated major
% scale with the same key signatures. The starting note is C, which is the
% second note in the sequence of Bb. The sequence spans 14 notes, whic is
% equivalent to two octaves, in this case from C3 to C5. The output is a
% file named ENSO.abc, which contains abc notation. Its content is the
% following:
